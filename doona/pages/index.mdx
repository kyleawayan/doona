# Kyle Awayan

Hi, I'm Kyle. I’m a creative student with a programming and digital media
background.

I'm a fourth year undergrad at the University of California, Merced. I'm
majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in web and app development. Aside
from technology, I also like creating music and visual art!

Please check out some of my [projects](/projects).
