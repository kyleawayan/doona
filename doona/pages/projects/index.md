  "A shot of Kyle's Magic Mirror. In the mirror's reflection, Kyle is seen
  holding his DSLR camera to take a picture of the Magic Mirror. The Mirror
  magically shows information 'through' the mirror: on the top, the time, date,
  weather, weekly forecast, calendar events are shown. News headlines are shown
  at the bottom of the mirror. Alongside the mirror is an iPhone 5. The iPhone
  shows a folder on the home screen, with the folder's name being 'Mirror'. The
  folder contains three shortcuts: 'Start', 'Restart', and 'Shut Down'. The
  start button icon is a white play icon on a black background. The restart
  button icon is a white circular pattern on a blue background. The shut down
  icon is a white, hollow square on a red background."
