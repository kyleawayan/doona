It was a long time ago... but my first ever project that involved what I do now
as a software engineer was a Magic Mirror. I don't remember exactly why I wanted
to build one, but most likely it was because it popped up online somewhere and
had to do with a Raspberry Pi, and I thought it was cool.

I used MichMich's [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)
platform for the software. His software is what runs on the Raspberry Pi, and
shows things like the time and weather on the screen behind the mirror. It is
also modular, so there are a bunch of plugins available.

After messing around with the software on a Raspberry Pi, I made the decision to
make a full-fledged Magic Mirror. With my dad's help, we had to make a frame
that held a screen behind a mirror.

I first stripped a old monitor we had laying around.

In front of the screen would be a two-way mirror from a glass shop, TAP
Plastics. It's basically a mirror that reflects on one side, but is see-through
on the other side. By putting a screen behind the mirror, you'll be able to see
the text on the screen while still being able to see your reflection.

We constructed the frame in a way that we can slide the mirror up and down in
front of the screen. I was going to present this at my local DIY show & tell
convention, Maker Faire, so it was best for demonstration purposes and also if I
ever need to replace the mirror.

After we built the frame, the Magic Mirror was finished.

There is an outlet splitter for the monitor and Raspberry Pi. There is also an
HDMI input (with a DVI adapter) for the monitor. This makes all the cables nice
and compact, ultimately just only needing one outlet from the outside.

A week later, I presented it at my local Maker Faire, my local DIY show & tell
convention!

After that, I left it on my desk for a while. It was later put away since I
wanted to make more space on my desk.

I actually made another one for my robotics high school class a year later. We
were making an escape room, and it would've been perfect to implement. Nobody
would expect to see text on the mirror itself!
