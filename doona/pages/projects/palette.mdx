I was browsing around, and found someone's
[DeviantArt mockup](https://www.deviantart.com/btchdirectioner/art/iu-palette-album-cover-mockup-844941581)
of an album art from IU, a K-pop artist. Originally, the album art looks like
this...

Surrounding the photo are abstract strokes of pink and blue paint on the border of the frame."
/>

The person re-made this album art in Photoshop as a template, so you're able to
change the image and text. However, this is not very accessible to people who
don't have Photoshop, so I wanted to make a fun web app that anyone can use to
make their own album art.

I quickly thought about how I was going to make this app. Everything was do-able
in my head: create a straightforward UI that encapsulates the album art
template, handle uploading and implement a simple cropping system. However, I
didn't know how the user was going to be able to save the album art they
created. Luckily, the app [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) came into my mind.
Carbon is an app where you can paste your code, and it'll basically put it into
a pretty frame. For example...

The dark-themed code editor window casts a subtle drop shadow, enhancing the visual representation of a desktop coding environment. The displayed code includes an import statement and a functional component that centers its children elements using CSS modules."

I looked at [Carbon's source code](https://github.com/carbon-app/carbon), and
tried to look for the library they were using that related to saving webpages to
images. I found [dom-to-img](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image), a library
to save parts of the webpage to an image file. Now that I found a way to save a
generated image, I had the whole app planned out. It was time to start getting
the resources for the album art.

First I took the album art and cut out the picture.

Then I looked at the person's mockup, then checked what font they were using. It
was called "LTC Bodoni 175." I searched for it online, and found that it comes
with my Adobe Fonts subscription, with website licensing too. Sweet!

I then made a basic UI, and then the app was functioning.

Surrounding the photo are abstract strokes of pink and blue paint on the border of the frame. Below the image is a 'download' button.

For cropping, I decided to use the
[react-easy-crop](https://github.com/ValentinH/react-easy-crop) library. I liked
this library as it was very minimal--no sliders or anything like that, just a
simple one where you can drag and scroll. It even came with guide lines too!

  alt="A gif showing a demo of the cropping feature. An image is loaded into the frame, then dragged around to adjust the position. The image is then resized by zooming in and out with the mouse or touchscreen."
/>

To indicate that the photo was movable/croppable, I flashed the guide when the
user inserted a photo. I wanted to see if people would know that they had the
ability to adjust the photo. I asked my friends to test the website without
mentioning the cropping feature. After they finished using it, I asked them
about the first action they took upon loading a photo. All of them said they
moved the photo around. Even some of them said that they would've still moved it
even if the guide didn't show up at all. This cropping feature is similar to
posting a photo on Instagram, so most people should be able to use it, at least
Gen Z...

I implemented the library, but there was one more problem left: setting the
initial size of the photo. Basically, the problem was that if the user loaded a
huge photo, it would be too big for the frame, and if the user loaded a small
photo, it would be too small for the frame. The user would either need to zoom
out or zoom in extraneously to fit their image. To fix this, I coded a quick
algorithm that takes in account image size and device size. No matter how big or
small photo or device, the photo will always be the perfect size when loaded
into the template.

After I was done with that, the app was done. I had one more thing... IU is a
Korean artist, so I wanted to add Korean translations to this app. I researched
a bit to find the most accurate Korean translator. I knew that it wasn't going
to be perfect, but I wanted Koreans to at least have an easier time
understanding. I used [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next)
to handle the language changing. I implemented English and _likely less
accurate_ Korean translations, then made it so if the user's browser language
was set to Korean, the app would automatically switch to Korean.

As I was putting the finishing touches, I tagged the GitHub repository with
"IU". I was curious and checked the other repositories tagged with "IU". There's
a good amount! I starred some that I liked.

A few hours later, a developer from one of the repositories I starred made a
[pull request to fix the Korean translations](https://github.com/kyleawayan/palette/pull/1).
Huge thanks to [wonderlandpark](https://github.com/wonderlandpark) for
contributing.

Once I made the finishing touches and added SEO, it was completely finished. I
deployed it on Vercel. Overall, this was a very fun project to make!
