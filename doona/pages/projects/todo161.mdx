  'A screenshot of the todo161 app. From top to bottom: there is a huge number
  "4" in an LCD-style font, three buttons, and a list of tasks. The buttons are
  labeled "Add Action", "Add Event", and "Mark Completed". Beneath the buttons,
  there is a label "Things to do:" and a list of tasks. The list of tasks reads
  "Create README for todo161," "Hang out with friends, in 02:03:34" indicating a
  countdown, "Laundry," and "Homework Assignment #3."'
