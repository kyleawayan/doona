  Screenshot of a Grafana dashboard. On the top, there are two line graphs that
  have various colors filled underneath them. In the middle, there are two
  heatmap graphs showing a visible trend, in different shades of orange. On the
  bottom, there are two meters. Each meter has a number in the middle, and a
  semi-circle around it. The semi-circles are semi-filled at different levels.
