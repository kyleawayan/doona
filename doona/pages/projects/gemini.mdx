  A 3D render of the Gemini app window. The album art of NIKI's "Moonchild"
  album is shown filling the whole window's background. The album art depicts an
  ethereal scene with NIKI floating in a dark space. NIKI is dressed in a
  flowing white garment that gives the impression of lightness and movement, as
  if they are suspended in air or underwater. The surrounding darkness contrasts
  sharply with the brightness of the person's attire and skin, drawing focus to
  NIKI. The text "MOONCHILD" is written at the bottom of the album art. There is
  a backward, forward, and play/pause button at the bottom of the window. In the
  center left, there is bold text that reads "Tide", and under that text is
  smaller text that reads "NIKI".

  Gemini is an aesthetic "now playing" player for Spotify. It shows the title
  and artist of the song with the album art filling the background of the
  screen. It is an app that you can put in like a boba shop, so people know what
  song is playingâ€”in an aesthetic way.

      'A screenshot of the Gemini app, running on macOS. The top-left of the image has macOS window control buttons (red, yellow, green). The top-right has a pin button. The album art of NIKI\'s "Zephyr" album is shown filling the whole window\'s background. It features a central image of NIKI with their eyes closed, seemingly at peace, with their head tilted slightly to the side. Her hair is wet or slicked back, and they are surrounded by soft focus flowers and greenery, giving the impression of a serene, natural setting. On the bottom of the window, from left to right, there is a menu icon, shuffle icon, backward icon, play/pause icon, forward icon, and repeat icon. In the center of the window, there is bold text that reads "Vintage", and under that text is smaller text that reads "NIKI".'
