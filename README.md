Kyle's Portfolio 2023.

This repo is a fork of the [Nextra](https://nextra.site) source code. This fork
contains some of my customizations of the blog theme. Since the monorepo has
everything hooked up together, I just decided to put my portfolio in here.

## Development

### Installation

The doona repository uses [PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and
[Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo). To install dependencies, run
`pnpm install` in the project root directory.

### Live Editing

From the project root directory...

```sh
pnpm dev:doona
```
